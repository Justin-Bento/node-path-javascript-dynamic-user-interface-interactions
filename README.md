# Dynamic User Interface Interactions

In this repository, I’ll be using JavaScript to build a general collection of user-interface components. The only limitation of this project is that I’ll stick to using the core three technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—avoiding any complex CSS frameworks.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Web Components 

- **Drop-down menus** - A dropdown is something you’ve most likely encountered on various other websites you’ve visited or apps you’ve used. Imagine any time you’ve clicked a button (usually one that contained an icon of 3 horizontal or vertical dots or lines) and a list of items suddenly appeared (you could even say these items… dropped down from the button).

- **Image carousel** - Image carousels are very common across various types of websites, including online stores, news sites, and many more. They’re great for advertising, showcasing things, showing several things using limited screen size, and can actually be made using things you’ve already learned! They are also highly customizable - you can make them auto-scroll, allow users to manually cycle between slides, skip to certain slides, etc.
