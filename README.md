# Dynamic User Interface Interactions

JavaScript is a very powerful language. It is capable of creating complex web applications that work everywhere. But it is just as often used on a smaller scale. JavaScript is the glue that holds even less flashy websites together- it makes drop-downs drop down and image sliders slide.

## Drop-down menus

A dropdown is something you’ve most likely encountered on various other websites you’ve visited or apps you’ve used. Imagine any time you’ve clicked a button (usually one that contained an icon of 3 horizontal or vertical dots or lines) and a list of items suddenly appeared (you could even say these items… dropped down from the button).

## Image carousel

Image carousels are very common across various types of websites, including online stores, news sites, and many more. They’re great for advertising, showcasing things, showing several things using limited screen size, and can actually be made using things you’ve already learned! They are also highly customizable - you can make them auto-scroll, allow users to manually cycle between slides, skip to certain slides, etc.
